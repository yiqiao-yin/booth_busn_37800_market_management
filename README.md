# Course Goals üéØ

## Welcome to Modern Marketing Practices

This course is designed with the following goals in mind:

   We aim to introduce you to the fundamentals of modern marketing practice. Marketing strategy is integral across the business organization and demands the ability to execute across various dimensions.

   The course will provide a theoretical basis and data-driven techniques that are essential for informed marketing decision-making.

   You will get acquainted with practices typically employed by marketing consulting firms. This class will help you navigate through the jargon and make well-informed decisions by understanding which techniques are appropriate in various scenarios.

### Special Focus on Consumer Heterogeneity

Marketing stands out from other subjects you will study here at Booth, particularly because of its focus on consumer heterogeneity. We embrace the idea that one size does not fit all and that creating value involves understanding and catering to different consumer types.

### Integration with Microeconomics and Competitive Strategy

Marketing complements your studies in microeconomics and competitive strategy:

- **Microeconomics**: Often focuses on aggregate demand and supply.
- **Competitive Strategy**: Centers on the interactions between a company and its competitive environment.

Together with the company (C) and competition (C) from micro and competitive strategy, the customer (C) analysis focus of this class completes the '3Cs of Strategy'.

### Framework for Marketing

The 3Cs (**Customer**, **Company**, & **Competition**) along with the 4Ps (**Product**, **Price**, **Promotion**, & **Place**) will form the overall framework for our marketing studies.
