# Summary of Session 2: Customer Analysis

## Continued Discussion on Customer Analysis

We built upon our previous discussions, focusing particularly on Steps 2 and 3 of Customer Analysis, which involve segmentation and targeting strategies to better understand and cater to the customer base.

### Step 2: Segmentation

#### Understanding the Need for Segmentation
- We recognized that customer needs are heterogeneous and vary widely, necessitating the grouping of customers with similar needs into segments. This approach helps in addressing the specific needs of each group effectively.
- Segmentation involves collecting and analyzing data on customer needs, behaviors, and attitudes. Methods like surveys are traditionally used to gather this data, but more recent approaches include analyzing large-scale behavioral data, provided it is validated accurately.

#### Cluster Analysis
- Cluster analysis is employed to handle scenarios with numerous base variables where simple segmentation is not feasible. It helps in identifying a manageable number of distinct segments by grouping consumers based on similarity in their needs and behaviors.
- The process starts by calculating the distance between each pair of individuals, grouping those that are closest into the same segment. We use various criteria, including managerial judgment and statistical tools like the Elbow plot, to decide the optimal number of segments.

#### Descriptor Variables
- Once segments are defined, we characterize them using descriptor variables which include demographics and other relevant information. For instance, data from social media platforms like Twitter can provide insights into demographics and user engagement levels.
- Understanding these descriptors is crucial for crafting targeted marketing strategies that are tailored to the specific characteristics and preferences of each segment.

### Step 3: Targeting

#### Selection of Target Segments
- The targeting step involves deciding which of the previously identified segments to focus on. This decision is influenced by internal factors and is inherently subjective, often requiring input from both marketing and non-marketing team members.
- We evaluate segments based on several factors including their size, profitability, and growth potential. This helps in assessing the attractiveness of each segment to the firm.

#### Multifactor Targeting Model
- To systematically evaluate and select target segments, we use the Multifactor Targeting Model. This model scores each segment based on its attractiveness and the firmâ€™s ability to serve it, integrating these scores into a comprehensive decision matrix.
- The model reduces subjectivity in segment selection, employing methodologies like the Delphi method to gather consensus among experts.

### Case Study Discussion: Chase Sapphire

#### Overview of the Case
- The discussion revolved around Chase Sapphire's strategy to target affluent and savvy customers, initially with its regular card and subsequently with the Reserve card aimed at younger customers.
- It was important to understand why Chase chose to target this particular group, especially given their lower market share compared to competitors like Amex and the specific spending habits of the target group.

#### Key Takeaways
- The case highlighted the importance of aligning targeting strategies with overall business goals and the potential benefits of focusing on customers who are likely to use multiple products.
- We also considered the economic implications of targeting customers who are typically "transactors," emphasizing the need for strategies that might encourage them to revolve balances under certain conditions.
