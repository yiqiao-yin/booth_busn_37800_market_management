# Recap of Session 5

This session focused on understanding the dynamics of competition and segmentation using perceptual maps and discussing strategic decisions in the context of case studies.

## 1. Understanding Competition and Segmentation

To explore how competition can disrupt segmentation, we revisited the Perceptual Map, plotting Competitors, Company, and Customers. We simplified the perceptual map into a 2-D picture, with perceived quality on the X-Axis and price on the Y-Axis:

- **Perceived Quality**: Represents an "omnibus" benefit that combines all benefits from the perceptual map.
- **Price vs. Quality Trade-offs**: We examined how trade-offs between price and quality affect market segmentation.

### Value Equivalence Line (VEL)

- **Placement of Customer Segments**: Segments were placed on the map according to their desired quality level at specific price points.
- **Segment Representation**: Segments are arrayed on a line called the Value Equivalence Line (VEL), represented as bars whose heights denote segment size.
- **Market Dynamics**: In a stable market, firms target specific segments. Over time, as firms aim to increase profits and target additional segments, the VEL becomes crowded, prompting firms to differentiate via value-advantaged positions.

### Strategic Implications

- **Disruption of Segmentation**: Moves by a firm or its competitors can disrupt segmentation, necessitating a strategic evaluation of potential moves like line extensions.
- **High-End Line Extensions**: Introducing lower-end products by high-end firms can accelerate cannibalization unless the quality gap is maintained, which encourages loyalty to high-end products.

## 2. Barco Case Discussion

The group presented the Barco case, highlighting strategic decisions in response to Sony's entry into the high-end market at a low price.

### Key Points

- **Product and Pricing Strategy**: Continuing with the current product (BD700) was deemed non-viable due to the superior BG400 and the need to maintain leadership.
- **Innovation Push**: Barco needed to innovate (BG800) to counter the price-based competition from Sony.
- **Supplier Relationships**: The dependency on Sony as a supplier was a risk, emphasizing the need to develop new suppliers.
- **Customer-Centric Modifications**: Allowing customers to upgrade electronics while retaining other projector components was discussed as a strategy to maintain loyalty and defend against Sony's aggressive pricing.

## 3. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) in the Chase Case

We reviewed the concept of Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) as covered in the Chase case.

### Strategic Use of CLV

- **Retention Investments**: By measuring CLV at various retention rates, firms can determine the optimal investment to enhance retention.
- **Assessment of Acquisition Costs**: It's crucial to assess whether the acquisition costs are justified by the projected future revenues (as demonstrated in the Chase scenario).
- **Profitable Loyalty Building**: Strategies should focus on building loyalty profitably, avoiding excessive spending on potentially unprofitable customers.

## Conclusion

This session illustrated the complex interplay between market segmentation, competition, and strategic decision-making. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for effectively navigating market challenges and seizing opportunities.

## Quantitative Analysis of Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a crucial metric in understanding the long-term value of a customer to a company. It quantifies the total revenue a business can reasonably expect from a single customer account throughout the business relationship. The calculation of CLV can help in making informed decisions about how much a company should spend on acquiring and retaining customers.

### Mathematical Formula for CLV

The basic formula to calculate CLV is:

$$\text{CLV} = \sum_{t=0}^{n} \frac{R_t}{(1 + d)^t}$$

Where:
- $R_t$ is the net revenue from the customer at time $t$.
- $d$ is the discount rate.
- $n$ is the number of periods over which the revenue is expected.

This formula assumes that revenues are being generated at regular intervals and discounts future revenues to present value, which considers the time value of money.

### Expanded CLV Model

A more detailed approach to CLV, especially useful in subscription-based models or where customer relationships are dynamic, includes factors like retention rate and churn. The expanded formula is:

$$\text{CLV} = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{m \cdot r^t}{(1 + d)^t}$$

Where:
- $m$ represents the margin per period.
- $r$ is the retention rate, the probability that a customer will continue to be a customer in each subsequent period.

### Example: Calculating CLV

Consider a customer who pays an annual subscription of $100, with a company profit margin of 25%, a retention rate of 90% per year, and a discount rate of 10%.

$$\text{CLV} = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{0.25 \times 100 \times 0.9^t}{(1 + 0.1)^t}$$

This formula can be simplified and calculated using an infinite series if $n$ approaches infinity and the retention rate remains constant:

$$\text{CLV} = \frac{0.25 \times 100 \times 0.9}{1 + 0.1 - 0.9} = \$225$$

This suggests that the present value of future net profits from this customer, considering retention and discount factors, is $225.

### Strategic Implications of CLV

Understanding CLV helps businesses:
- **Allocate Resources**: Determine how much to invest in customer acquisition and retention.
- **Segment Customers**: Identify high-value customers for targeted marketing campaigns.
- **Optimize Marketing Spend**: Balance the cost of attracting new customers with the benefits of retaining existing ones.
- **Forecast Revenue**: Project future revenues based on anticipated customer behaviors.

### Limitations

While CLV is a powerful tool, its accuracy is dependent on the reliability of the assumptions about future revenue streams, costs, retention rates, and discount rates. Changes in the business environment or customer behavior can significantly impact the actual CLV.

## Conclusion

Quantifying the Customer Lifetime Value allows businesses to make strategic decisions that balance immediate costs with long-term benefits. This quantitative approach provides a foundation for building a customer-centric business strategy focused on long-term profitability.
