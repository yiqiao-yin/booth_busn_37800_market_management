Summary of Session 1 

  

1)   We first tried to visit our prior beliefs about the what marketing does in an attempt to put together a framework for studying marketing. The idea of marketing reflecting both "math" and "magic" will underlie a lot of what we will be doing. The relationship between marketing and competitive strategy and economics was also mentioned.



2) We had a brief discussion on why we needed marketing in a world of increasing “sameness”, and the potential tension between finance and marketing and the possible role of data and analytics to address that tension. We then set up our overall framework for the course. This led to the consideration of the 3Cs (Customer, Company and Competition) and the 4 Ps (Product, Price, Place and Promotion) under the two broad areas of Marketing Strategy and Marketing Tactics. Also think of this as the Art (strategy) and the Craft (implementation / tactics) of marketing. As we noted, the art stays the same but the craft has evolved over time.

  

2)    Next, we started our discussion of Customer Analysis. There are 4 steps to customer analysis. We tackled step 1 in class today. I will try to speed up a bit more tomorrow when we tackle the other steps.

 

Step 1: Understand customer needs (wants, attitudes and behaviors). The way we do this is via Market Research – often via exploratory research (focus groups, ethnographic research, etc.) and progressing to more advanced descriptive and causal research. We said that there are 3 types of needs – Functional, Emotional and Social. Functional needs a company needs to satisfy as without that consumers are unlikely to buy the product. However, these needs can be fulfilled by many companies so do not give one a lasting advantage. So, products and services also try to fulfill emotional needs – here we said that the need (love) needs to be tied strongly to the product (Subaru). Finally, there are social needs that were fulfilled by, as we saw Peugeot and LinkedIn. 

 

However, we also said that many needs are unarticulated (“variety” or flexibility in the case of the CD player / iPod example). In order to understand these unarticulated needs one can use tools like consumption chains and customer journeys. Essentially these entail going through the steps the customer goes through when buying your product or service.



We also talked about "market driven" strategies - most of what we do in organizations where we follow the lead of the customers and what they tell us (the voice of the customer) as opposed to "market driving" strategies which help firms create new categories by tapping into needs that were perhaps not articulated to market driven firms.


We briefly mentioned other aspects of marketing such as new product development, types of testing (concept vs market tests; alpha- versus beta-tests)


Finally, we set up our discussion of Step 2 by recognizing that needs are heterogeneous and it is critical to understand these differences to be better able to meet them.
