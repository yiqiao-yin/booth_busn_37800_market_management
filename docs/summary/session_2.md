Summary of Session 2 

 

We continued our discussion of Customer Analysis and went over steps 2 and 3.



Step 2: Size up the various needs (Segmentation) – the recognition that needs are heterogeneous requires you to figure out groups that might have similar needs. Based on the needs identified in step 1 (or attitudes, behavior), construct e.g., a survey that asks consumers about the extent of their needs, or as discussed in class, there are many other more recent approaches of leveraging large scale data on behaviors as long as we take care to validate those data. These are the bases variables used in segmentation and are relevant to my business outcomes. While we looked at a simple example of two bases variables, we recognized that there might b many more, so we need statistical approaches such as Cluster Analysis.

Cluster analysis is a method that helps us arrive at a small number of segments in situations where we had many bases variables and we could not easily divide the population into meaningful sub-groups. The basic idea is to group those consumers that are similar in their bases variables into a segment, i.e., we want to minimize the variance across respondents assigned to a segment. To do this we first computed a “distance” between each pair of individuals and then assigned those that are “close” to each other into the same segment. To determine the “right” number of segments we used managerial criteria such as size, or PLC stage (as mentioned in the class discussion), etc (although there is a more statistical criterion called the Elbow (or scree) plot that I showed in class).  

Now that we have our segments we need to describe them since we need to figure out ways to “reach” the consumers. So we go into each segment and compute their average demographic profiles. These demographic variables that are also measured at the time of the bases variable survey (or e.g., the demographics from where the Twitter user is from, whether they are heavy or light Tweeters etc, if for example we are using Twitter data) are referred to as the descriptor variables. So now we know the segments and who is in each of the segments. 
 
We noted that it is important that segments are distinct from one another in their bases and descriptor variables
 

Now that we have our segments, we need to describe them since we need to figure out ways to “reach” the consumers or "target" new customers for the firm. These variables are referred to as the descriptor variables. So now we know the segments and who is in each of the segments. 

 

Step 3 of Customer Analysis (Targeting):  

 

Which segment to pursue? In terms of Targeting, the main idea was to figure out how to make a determination of which of the segments we identified in the segmentation stage (Step 2) we needed to target. Note that this is an internal firm decision so is subject to the nature of decision-making in your marketing team. By definition, this is fraught with subjectivity so it is good to involve a team of (both marketing and if necessary, non-marketing) folks in the decision making as we discussed in class. For this we needed to recognize factors that affected (i) the attractiveness of the segments to us as the firm (size, profitability, growth rate, etc. – some of these measures are clearly more objective) and (ii) the ability of the firm to serve the segments – i.e., the company’s strengths vis-à-vis the segments.  We then weighted the factors and gave them scores for each of the segments we were considering to come up with indices of segment attractiveness and company strength for each segment. We then put these into a matrix and dubbed it the Multifactor Targeting Model. This helps us hone in on one or more of the segments we identified via cluster analysis. To reduce subjectivity we leverage the Delphi method.


Then we discussed the Chase Sapphire case



The group did a terrific job hitting most of the key points that reduced my need to weigh in a whole lot on the case. Here are some additional thoughts to keep in mind. The company was trying to first target the savvy, affluent customer (regular & Preferred) and then the young, savvy and affluent customer (Reserve). The first question you want to ask yourself is: Why? From the case it seemed that this is a group that Chase was lagging behind Amex (its overall share was 22% of the market but only 15% of the 15% that accounted for over 50% of the transactions). They were also a rewards hungry group but were mainly transactors. Further, the young also liked to churn. So given this profile should you be targeting this group? The economics suggests: “Yes”, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES as the group pointed out if you can get them to revolve but that might be inconsistent with what they do (if these are transactors going to AmEx). Then there has to be another reason for doing so. This is where thinking about the overall strategy of the business is important - perhaps we want to attract these customers to maximize returns across all the products and services we can market to them?
