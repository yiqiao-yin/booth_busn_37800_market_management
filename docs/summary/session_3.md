Summary of Session 3

We first did Step 4 of Customer Analysis (recall Step 1: Market Research; Step 2: Segmentation; Step 3: Targeting), then the Aleph Farms case.



Step 4 - Positioning: Convincing the target customers: It is time now to try and convince the members of the target market to buy our product or service. The basic insight here is that the way in which consumers think about the different brands is in the way they are arrayed along the different benefits they offer consumers. The location of brands along the benefits in the consumers’ minds or their perceptions is what we refer to as the brands “position.” Hence the picture of these perceptions is a perceptual map. A perceptual map, to be useful, needs to have 2 types of information. The first is perceptual information. How do we get this? One option is survey information. First, via exploratory research, we identify the key benefits that consumers seek in a product (based in the various needs they might have). Then we seek a representative sample's perceptions of different brands in the category along the benefits previously identified. Perceptual information gives us the locations of brands along the various benefits. Second, we need preference information. This will tell us where the consumer segments are, based on their preferences for the various brands whose locations we have already pinned down. Given the relative location of a brand and a segment, the brand can plot repositioning moves as discussed in class depending on whether there is a design problem (Bud's price is much higher than Miller's) or a perception problem (Bud's price is the same as Miller's but it is perceived as being more expensive).

 

Next we discussed different types of perceptual maps – simple 2D ones as well as more complicated ones.

 

We also introduced another method called Principal Components Analysis (PCA) method) –Why did we need it? For two reasons (i) because often as marketers, consumers tell us that there are more than 2 benefits that they care about and these benefits might be correlated; and (ii) the benefits can be of different “importances” for the consumers. So it is difficult to depict them in a simple X-Y graph. The output gives us the various original benefits as arrows as well as the relative locations on the various brands. So how do we interpret the PCA map?

The angle between 2 arrows (benefits) represents the degree to which the benefits are correlated with each other.

The length of the arrow captures the variability in that attribute across brands (the more the brands vary in their perceptions within a benefit, longer the arrow). So it can be thought of as “importance.”

With all this information, we can now interpret the locations of the brands along an arrow or benefit by simply looking at where the brand “drops down” onto the benefit line. The brand that is farthest out in the direction of the arrow is perceived to be the highest along that benefit and the brand at the back end of the arrow (you may need to extend it out back from the origin) is perceived to be the lowest.

Next, we can label the 2 principal components (the X and Y axes of the map) based on the attributes that have the smallest angles to them. Note that this nomenclature is entirely subjective and somewhat arbitrary. Often, managers are only shown the maps with the principal components with the arrows deleted. Although this simplifies the map, you should always be curious about what went into creating the map and how much of the variance is being reflected in it – especially if messaging plans are made based on it as we discussed in the case of Budweiser.

In the beer map I showed you in the slides, we also plotted the preference segments on the same map. This is done by taking the preference data and superimposing it on the map from PCA. How do we do this? Essentially we locate a segment such that it is closest to the brands for which it has the highest preferences for and farthest from those it has the lowest preferences. The size of the circle depicts the size of the segment.


Now we are now back to a 2-dimensional map with brands and segments so we can go back to our strategizing – how to position / re-position brands, etc

Before repositioning first identify whether you have a “design” problem or a “perception” problem. With the former we may first need to do R&D and change the Product (I am perceived as being fuel inefficient when I actually have a terrible engine) and then communicate this to consumers; with the latter we need to change perceptions via communications – the Promotions P but don’t necessarily have to change the product.
The perceptual map can became the input into a couple of decisions.

 

a.       Deciding which “P” levers we pulled depending on whether you have a “messaging” issue (true attribute is good but perception is bad) or a “design” problem (underlying attribute is bad - e.g., price is too high)

 

b.       Formulating a positioning statement (ABC).



We concluded our discussion of Customer Analysis with the Positioning Statement – Audience (A) – Benefit (B) – Compelling Reason (C) by highlighting that the C part is the toughest for any brand.



Aleph Farms Case



Again, the group walked us through the important considerations for this case.



The company needs to make several decisions – starting out with its GTM (go-to-market ) strategy in Singapore, the segment that it needs to pursue as well as how to position the product for this segment. It also had longer term considerations on branding, the logo, how it was going to scale and the next set of products to focus its R&D efforts on. 

 

To answer the segmentation question, we first focused on the benefits provided by cultured meat in general and the needs that these benefits serviced. These included Environmental, Humane treatment of animals, Safety (contamination, etc), Health (the meat can be modified), (no) Antibiotics so reduced resistance, Societal benefit if prices decline, Transparency / Traceability and Consistency in quality. These needs and benefits however differed in terms of the time period over which the benefit accrued, the size of the benefits, whether the needs satisfied were functional, emotional or social, whether they benefited the individual or society and whether they came about by reducing a negative of conventional meat or provided a positive benefit over that option. At this point, if we could do more market research, we would gather data on attitudes, needs and behaviors vis-à-vis these needs as well as behavior in terms of conventional meat. If we need to proceed then we need to provide a relative weight on these segments. We discussed some potential positioning approaches (environment, technology, new culinary experiences) but also highlighted the barriers to adoption such as price, not being natural, taste etc. One way of circumventing this could be by positioning as a complement to other products such as tacos or salad. Finally, we spent some time on the economics of the product and capacity-related issues. 

 

Going forward, we mentioned how it was critical to first get all the approvals, get a plant up and running, lower own costs as much as possible and hope conventional meat prices increase over time, go beyond thin steak MVP to mimic real steak better.  

 

The key takeaways from the case are to understand clearly the value proposition(s) of the product, their size and duration of realization. All this lead up to understanding the Product-Market fit for the segments and positioning the product. At the same time, it is important to recognize the barriers to adoption, what entry strategy to formulate in the presence of these. Ultimately, this is a complex technology and since it is related to food, the road to success is unlikely to be lined with roses. However, the company can take inspiration on how well plant-based meats have performed and the 3X premium they command.
